Unroll
======

.. autofunction:: pragma.unroll

Unroll constant loops. If the `for`-loop iterator is a known value at function definition time, then replace it with its body duplicated for each value. For example::

    def f():
    for i in [1, 2, 4]:
        yield i

could be identically replaced by::

    def f():
        yield 1
        yield 2
        yield 4

The ``unroll`` decorator accomplishes this by parsing the input function, performing the unrolling transformation on the function's AST, then compiling and returning the defined function.

``unroll`` is currently smart enough to notice literal defined variables and literals, as well as able to unroll the ``range`` function and unroll nested loops::

    @pragma.unroll
    def summation(x=0):
        a = [x, x, x]
        v = 0
        for _a in a:
            v += _a
        return v

    # ... Becomes ...

    def summation(x=0):
        a = [x, x, x]
        v = 0
        v += x
        v += x
        v += x
        return v

    # ... But ...

    @pragma.unroll
    def f():
        x = 3
        for i in [x, x, x]:
            yield i
        x = 4
        a = [x, x, x]
        for i in a:
            yield i

    # ... Becomes ...

    def f():
        x = 3
        yield 3
        yield 3
        yield 3
        x = 4
        a = [x, x, x]
        yield 4
        yield 4
        yield 4

    # Even nested loops and ranges work!

    @pragma.unroll
    def f():
        for i in range(3):
            for j in range(3):
                yield i + j

    # ... Becomes ...

    def f():
        yield 0 + 0
        yield 0 + 1
        yield 0 + 2
        yield 1 + 0
        yield 1 + 1
        yield 1 + 2
        yield 2 + 0
        yield 2 + 1
        yield 2 + 2

Also supported are recognizing top-level breaks. Breaks inside conditionals aren't yet supported, though they could eventually be by combining unrolling with literal condition collapsing::

    @pragma.unroll
    def f(y):
        for i in range(100000):
            for x in range(2):
                if i == y:
                    break
            break

    # ... Becomes ...

    def f(y):
        for x in range(2):
            if 0 == y:
                break
